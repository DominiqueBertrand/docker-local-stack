# Postgres and pgAdmin with Docker and Docker compose

This project allow us to run PostgreSQL and pgAdmin in docker for local development using docker compose.

Using Docker-Compose has these benefits:

- it can be faster, repeatable, and automatic
- it saves you from installing the database directly on your host machine
- it allows you to have multiple different versions of the database, in case each of your projects requires you to use different versions.
