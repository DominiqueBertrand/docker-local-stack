# Mongo with Docker Compose

A set of docker-compose stack that allows you to turn on a full MongoDB :
- mongo-stack-docker-compose: docker-compose stack that allows you to turn on a full MongoDB instance + Mongo Express
- mongo-shard-docker-compose: docker-compose stack that allows you to turn on a full MongoDB sharded cluster

Designed to be quick and simple to get a local or test environment up and running. Needless to say... 

**DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!**
